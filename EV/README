EV
----------
Calculates the expectation value of any hand.

Test.cpp is the testing code. You can change different calculators by modifying
the EvMain function.

Currently it only supports SimpleCalculator, SimpleFastCalculator and
AdvancedCalculator.

The SimpleCalculator assumes the deck is infinitely large, and each card has
exactly 1/13 probability of being drawed.

The SimpleFastCalculator adds dynamic programming to speed up the calculation.

The AdvancedCalculator doesn't assume that each card has equal probability all
the time. For example drawing an Ace will reduce one Ace from the stack,
as a result it will reduce the probability of drawing another Ace next time, but
will increase the probability of drawing other cards.

= Running examples =

	$ ./EV
	> double
	Double on
	> split
	Split on
	> split off
	Split off
	> run 16 10
	Hit: 
	EV -0.573610

	Stand: 
	EV -0.575058

	Double: 
	EV -1.070049

The command "run 16 10", computes the situation that player has a hand value at 
16, and the dealer has a 10. We can read that the EV of hit is slightly greater
than Stand, therefore stand is the optimal decision.

	> run s19 10
	Hit: 
	EV -0.156043

	Stand: 
	EV -0.015948

	Double: 
	EV -0.290014

The "run s19 10" command, computes the situation that player has soft 19, and
dealer has a 10.

The program can also run without interactive mode, by giving two arguments to
it. For example this computes the situation that player has soft 20 and dealer
has a 10.

	$ ./EV s20 10
	Hit: 
	EV -0.053438

	Stand: 
	EV 0.436011
